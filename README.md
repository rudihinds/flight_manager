# flight_manager
Crud app for minicab companies to monitor all airport landings and view any changes/delays/cancellations in realtime, all in one place for their drivers to get timely pickups. Created using good old fashioned vanilla createElement and querySelector JS, and a rails backend API, hooked up to Aviation Edge public API (currently apparently no longer free)
